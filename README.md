For a Descriptive Analytics Data Mining Project, I leveraged my skills in R and used the ggplot2 package to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis.
I used an economics relevant dataset to acquire 6 variables and established their relationships to my primary variable of income through the creation of an executive summary walking through the data collection process, describing the variables of interest, and discussing the overall structure of the dataset. Additionally, I developed several unique visualizations that told a visualized narrative regarding “what happened” in my data.
